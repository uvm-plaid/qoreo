Qoreo is a choreographic programming language for quantum networks and distributed systems.

# Install

Qoreo is written in Rocq and is tested with Rocq 9.0 and 9.1. It may not be compatible with earlier versions e.g. Coq 8.x.

I recommend installing Rocq via opam: https://rocq-prover.org/docs/using-opam

Qoreo uses the QuantumLib library for formalizing quantum computing (https://github.com/inQWIRE/QuantumLib) but the version compatible with Rocq 9.x is currently in a fork here: https://github.com/jpaykin/QuantumLib/tree/jpaykin/v9.1. You can install it via:

```
    opam pin coq-quantumlib https://github.com/jpaykin/QuantumLib.git#jpaykin/v9.1
```
